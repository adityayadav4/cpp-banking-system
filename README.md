# HVA BANKS - Simple C++ Banking System
This is a simple command-line banking application I created in C++ to practice my coding skills.

It's a console-based program that lets you manage bank accounts. It uses core C++ concepts like OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and STL containers like std::map.

# Features

# 1. Create New Account:
You can create a new bank account for a user with an initial deposit. The app will generate a random 4-digit account number.

# 2. Deposit Money: 
Add money to any existing account.

# 3. Withdraw Money: 
Take money from an account. The app checks to make sure you have enough balance.

# 4. Check Balance:
View the details of a specific account.

# 5. Display All Accounts: 
See a list of every account in the bank.

# 6. Exit:
Close the application.

# How to Compile and Run

This project is split into three files: main.cpp, Account.h, and Account.cpp. You will need a C++ compiler like g++ to run it.

# 1.Clone the Repository

``` git clone [your-github-repo-link] ```

# 2.Navigate to the Folder

``` cd [name-of-your-project-folder] ```

# 3.Compile the Code
In your terminal, run the following command to compile all the C++ files together:

``` g++ main.cpp Account.cpp -o banking_app ```

# 4.Run the Application
Execute the program you just created:

``` ./banking_app ```
